## Quick review of the game (what it *is*, in one pass)

StrataGem is a head-to-head, simultaneous-turn puzzle battler: you drag “pieces” from the River into your half of the basin, make matches (3+ orthogonally) to “damage” the opponent’s Stars, and when Stars break they send garbage rows back into the basin; overflow past the top loses.

Two genuinely differentiating mechanics (good marketing hooks):

* **Simultaneous turns + advancing River** (it’s not “I go / you go”; both players commit, then the board state advances).
* **Energy tactics: Rush + Double Cast** (both at 3 energy; energy ticks up per turn). Rush lets you place into the opponent’s half; Double Cast gives you a second drop stacked above the first.

Character layer:

* **Supers** charge from matches (primary-color matches give extra meter), and can replace your normal drop for the turn.
* **Passives** are character-specific, but the README notes the character-select “Details” button isn’t implemented yet (worth fixing before you promise “deep character mechanics” on the site).

## About section (one paragraph)

“StrataGem is a head-to-head puzzle battler: match gems to crack your opponent’s Stars and send garbage into their basin. When their board overflows, they lose. It’s simple to learn, but the energy system and character kits make it nasty.”

## One blunt suggestion for the landing page’s messaging

Lead with **“simultaneous turns + energy mind-games”**. That’s the thing that makes this *not* feel like “another match game,” and it’s also the easiest thing to communicate in a 5-second clip. The Stars/garbage explanation belongs lower on the page (About / How to Play), not in the hero.
